**`DO_WAIT`** - OPTIONAL    
By default, this action will not wait until scans have been completed. To have the workflow wait until all scans have been completed, set the `DO_WAIT` environment variable to `true`. Note that some other environment variables imply `DO_WAIT`, for example when exporting vulnerability data or generating job summaries. This behavior is documented in the applicable environment variable descriptions.
