|DO_SETUP<br/>SETUP_ACTION<br/>SETUP_EXTRA_OPTS|If `DO_SETUP` is set to `true` (implied if any of the other two `SETUP_*` variables are set), the FoD application and/or release will be automatically created if they do not yet exist and static scan settings will be configured if not configured already, using the fcli-provided [SSC `setup-appversion`]({{var:fcli-doc-base-url}}ssc-actions.html#_setup_appversion) or, if specified, the custom fcli action specified through `SETUP_ACTION`. Extra options for the fcli action can be passed through the `SETUP_EXTRA_OPTS` environment variable, for example to copy state from an existing application version using the `--copy-from` option, or to allow an unsigned custom action to be used. Note that if setup is enabled, `SSC_APPVERSION` must be configured with a qualified application version name; you cannot use application version id. Please see the [SSC Fcli Actions](#ssc-fcli-actions) section below for more details.|
