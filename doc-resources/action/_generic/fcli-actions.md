As indicated in the [Action environment variable inputs](#action-environment-variable-inputs) section above, this GitHub Action utilizes one or more fcli actions to perform certain activities. These fcli-provided actions are used as building blocks that can be re-used across different CI/CD platforms to provide consistent behavior across those platforms. This GitHub Action also provides the ability to override the default built-in fcli actions with custom fcli actions, allowing for rich customization capabilities. For example, such custom fcli actions could define different default values for some action options, perform some additional activities, and/or provide fully customized behavior.

For more information on fcli actions and custom action development, please see the [fcli action documentation]({{var:fcli-doc-base-url}}#_actions). Such custom actions may be hosted either on the local file system (for example stored in your source code repository) or some remote location; the `*_ACTION` environment variables may point to either a local file or URL. To easily share custom actions across multiple pipelines, you may want to consider hosting these in a dedicated source code repository that's accessible by all pipelines. This provides an easy hosting location, and allows for easy maintenance of such custom actions.
