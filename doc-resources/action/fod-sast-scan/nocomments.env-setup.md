|DO_SETUP<br/>SETUP_ACTION<br/>SETUP_EXTRA_OPTS|If `DO_SETUP` is set to `true` (implied if any of the other two `SETUP_*` variables are set), the application and/or release will be automatically created if they do not yet exist and static scan settings will be configured if not configured already, using the fcli-provided [`setup-release`]({{var:fcli-doc-base-url}}fod-actions.html#_setup_release) or, if specified, the custom fcli action specified through `SETUP_ACTION`. Extra options for the fcli action can be passed through the `SETUP_EXTRA_OPTS` environment variable. Depending on your Git workflow, it is recommended to have each newly created release copy state from the release representing your default branch by passing `--copy-from "${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.event.repository.default_branch }}"` through `SETUP_EXTRA_OPTS`. To allow the GitHub Action to create new applications, you must (also) provide the `--app-owner <user>` option through `SETUP_EXTRA_OPTS`. Note that if setup is enabled, `FOD_RELEASE` must be configured with a qualified release name; you cannot use release id. Please see the [Fcli Actions](#fortify-on-demand-fcli-actions) section below for more details.|
