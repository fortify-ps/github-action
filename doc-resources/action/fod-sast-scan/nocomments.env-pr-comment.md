|(PREVIEW)<br/>DO_PR_COMMENT<br/>PR_COMMENT_ACTION<br/>PR_COMMENT_EXTRA_OPTS|If `DO_PR_COMMENT` is set to `true` (implied if any of the other two `PR_COMMENT_*` variables are set, and implies `DO_WAIT`), a pull request comment listing new, re-introduced and removed issues will be generated using the fcli-provided [`github-pr-comment`]({{var:fcli-doc-base-url}}fod-actions.html#_github_pr_comment) action or, if specified, the custom fcli action specified through `PR_COMMENT_ACTION`. Extra options for the fcli action can be passed through the `PR_COMMENT_EXTRA_OPTS` environment variable, for example to allow an unsigned custom action to be used. Please see the [Fcli Actions](#fortify-on-demand-fcli-actions) and [Pull Request Comments](#fortify-on-demand-pull-request-comments) sections below for more details.|
