| DO_EXPORT<br/>EXPORT_ACTION<br/>EXPORT_EXTRA_OPTS | If `DO_EXPORT` is set to `true` (implied if any of the other two `EXPORT_*` variables are set, and implies `DO_WAIT`), this GitHub Action will will export scan results to the GitHub Security Code Scanning dashboard using the fcli-provided [SSC `github-sast-report`]({{var:fcli-doc-base-url}}ssc-actions.html#_github_sast_report) action or, if specified, the custom fcli action specified through `EXPORT_ACTION`. Extra options for the fcli action can be passed through the `EXPORT_EXTRA_OPTS` environment variable, for example to to allow an unsigned custom action to be used or to specify an alternative SSC filter set. Please see the [SSC Fcli Actions](#ssc-fcli-actions) section below for more details.<br/><br/>Note that this may require a [GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) subscription, unless you're running this action on a public github.com repository. GitHub only supports importing SAST results; other results will not exported to GitHub. |
