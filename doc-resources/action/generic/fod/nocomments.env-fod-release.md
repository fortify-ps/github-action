| FOD_RELEASE | Fortify on Demand release to use with this action. This can be specified either as a numeric release id, `<app-name>:<release-name>` (for non-microservices applications) or `<app-name>:<microservice-name>:<release-name>` (for microservices applications). Default value is based on repository and branch name, for example `myOrg/myRepo:myBranch`. Note that you'll need to explicitly configure `FOD_RELEASE` for microservices applications, as the default value lacks a microservice name. |
