**`DO_EXPORT`, `EXPORT_ACTION`, `EXPORT_EXTRA_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL    
If `DO_EXPORT` is set to `true` (which implies `DO_WAIT`) or when explicitly invoking the `fortify/github-action/fod-export` or `fortify/github-action/ssc-export` actions, this action will will export scan results to the GitHub Security Code Scanning dashboard using the fcli-provided `github-sast-report` action or, if specified, the custom fcli action specified through `EXPORT_ACTION`.  `EXPORT_ACTION` may point to a local file or URL; this custom fcli action must support (at least) the exact same action parameters (including any environment variable based default values for those parameters) as the built-in fcli action. Any extra options for the fcli action can be passed through the `EXPORT_EXTRA_OPTS` environment variable, for example to specify the SSC filter set from which to load issue data, or to allow an unsigned custom action to be used. Please see {{var:fcli-doc-base-url}}#_actions for more information. 

Note that this may require a [GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) subscription, unless you're running this action on a public github.com repository. GitHub only supports importing SAST results; other results will not exported to GitHub.
