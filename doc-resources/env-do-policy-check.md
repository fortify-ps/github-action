**`DO_POLICY_CHECK`, `CHECK_POLICY_ACTION`, `CHECK_POLICY_EXTRA_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL    
If `DO_POLICY_CHECK` is set to `true` (implied if any of the other two `CHECK_POLICY_*` variables are set, and implies `DO_WAIT`), a policy check will be run after scan completion using the fcli-provided [FoD `check-policy`]({{var:fcli-doc-base-url}}fod-actions.html#_check_policy) or [SSC `check-policy`]({{var:fcli-doc-base-url}}ssc-actions.html#_check_policy) action or, if specified, the custom fcli action specified through `CHECK_POLICY_ACTION`. `POLICY_CHECK_ACTION` may point to a local file or URL; this custom fcli action must accept at least the `--av` (for SSC) or `--rel` (for FoD) option. Any extra options for this custom fcli action can be passed through the `CHECK_POLICY_EXTRA_OPTS` environment variable, which may include fcli options to allow unsigned custom actions to be used. Note that for FoD, the fcli-provided `check-policy` action will check the outcome of the FoD security policy. As SSC doesn't provide any similar security policy features, the fcli-provided action executes some sample policy checks that will likely fail in many cases. As security policies are different for every Fortify customer, you should consider implementing your own custom fcli policy check action(s), unless FoD-provided security policy functionality is sufficient.
