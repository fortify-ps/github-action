**`CHECK_POLICY_ACTION`, `CHECK_POLICY_EXTRA_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL    
These inputs allow for running policy checks after scan completion. As security policies are different for every Fortify customer, we don't provide a default policy check action. `POLICY_CHECK_ACTION` may point to a local file or URL; this custom fcli action must accept at least the `--av` (for SSC) or `--rel` (for FoD) option. Any extra options for this custom fcli action can be passed through the `CHECK_POLICY_EXTRA_OPTS` environment variable, which may include fcli options to allow unsigned custom actions to be used. Fcli ships with sample `check-policy` actions that can be used as a basis for implementing your own policy checks. Please see {{var:fcli-doc-base-url}}#_actions for more information.
