**`DO_SETUP`, `SETUP_ACTION`, `SETUP_EXTRA_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL    
If `DO_SETUP` is set to `true` (implied if any of the other two `SETUP_*` variables are set), this action will set up the FoD release / SSC application version, creating those if they do not yet exist, using the fcli-provided [FoD `setup-release`]({{var:fcli-doc-base-url}}fod-actions.html#_setup_release)  or [SSC `setup-appversion`]({{var:fcli-doc-base-url}}ssc-actions.html#_setup_appversion) action, or, if specified, the custom fcli action specified through `SETUP_ACTION`. `SETUP_ACTION` may point to a local file or URL; this custom fcli action must support (at least) the exact same action parameters (including any environment variable based default values for those parameters) as the built-in fcli action. Any extra options for the fcli action can be passed through the `SETUP_EXTRA_OPTS` environment variable, for example to copy from an existing release/application version, or to allow an unsigned custom action to be used.

Note that if setup is enabled, `FOD_RELEASE` or `SSC_APPVERSION` must be configured with a qualified release/version name; you cannot use release/version id.
