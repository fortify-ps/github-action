**`DO_PR_COMMENT`, `PR_COMMENT_ACTION`, `PR_COMMENT_EXTRA_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL    
If `DO_PR_COMMENT` is set to `true` (implied if any of the other `PR_COMMENT_*` variables are set, and implies `DO_WAIT`), this action will generate a pull request comment listing new, re-introduced and removed issues using the fcli-provided `github-pr-comment` action or, if specified, the custom fcli action specified through `PR_COMMENT_ACTION`. `PR_COMMENT_ACTION` may point to a local file or URL; this custom fcli action must support (at least) the exact same action parameters (including any environment variable based default values for those parameters) as the built-in fcli action. Any extra options for the fcli action can be passed through the `PR_COMMENT_EXTRA_OPTS` environment variable, for example to specify the SSC filter set from which to load issue data, or to allow an unsigned custom action to be used. Please see {{var:fcli-doc-base-url}}#_actions for more information. 

Note that pull request comments will only be generated under the following conditions:

* `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable needs to be set to a valid GitHub token, for example from `{{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`.
* Standard `GITHUB_REF_NAME` environment variable points to a pull request.
* All other standard GitHub environment variables like `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` and `GITHUB_SHA` are set.

PR comments are generated by comparing scan results from the current GitHub Action run against the previous scan in the same application version/release; it won't detect any new/removed issues from older scans. For best results, you should configure the GitHub Action to run only on pull request creation (not on every commit) and optionally allow for manual runs (if you want to re-run the scan after a PR is updated). You should also configure the action to automatically create a dedicated application version/release for the current branch/PR, copying state from the main/parent branch version/release. This will allow the action to compare scan results for the current GitHub Action run against the last scan results of the main/parent branch.
