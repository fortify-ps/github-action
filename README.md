## Primary action

The primary `fortify/github-action@v1` currently allows for running SAST scans on either Fortify on Demand or ScanCentral SAST; future versions may add support for other activities like running DAST scans. Which activities to perform is controlled through action inputs, the input for those activities is provided through environment variables.

### Action inputs

**`sast-scan`**    
If not specified or when set to false, no SAST scan will be performed. When set to true, the action will run a SAST scan on either Fortify on Demand (if the FOD_URL environment variable has been specified), or on ScanCentral SAST (if the SSC_URL environment variable has been specified). This includes packaging the source code, running the scan, and optionally reporting scan results back into GitHub. 

To successfully perform the SAST scan, additional environment variables will need to be configured on the action as listed in these sections:

* Fortify on Demand: [`fortify/github-action/fod-sast-scan@v1`](#fod-sast-scan-action)
* ScanCentral SAST: [`fortify/github-action/sc-sast-scan@v1`](#sc-sast-scan-action)

### Sample workflows

TODO

## setup action


<!-- START-INCLUDE:action-setup.md -->

This action allows for setting up the Fortify tools listed below. Which tools and which versions to install, and whether to add the tool bin-directories to the system path, is controlled through action inputs as listed in the next section.

* [fcli](https://github.com/fortify/fcli)
* [ScanCentral Client](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/fortify-software-security-center/2310/SC_SAST_Help_23.1.0/index.htm#A_Clients.htm)
* [FoDUploader](https://github.com/fod-dev/fod-uploader-java)
* [FortifyVulnerabilityExporter](https://github.com/fortify/FortifyVulnerabilityExporter)
* [FortifyBugTrackerUtility](https://github.com/fortify-ps/FortifyBugTrackerUtility)

### Action inputs

**`export-path`**    
Whether to add the installed tools to the system PATH variable. Allowed values: `true` (default) or `false`

**`fcli`**    
The fcli version to install. Allowed values: `skip` (default value, do not install fcli), `latest`, or specific version number. Supports semantic versioning, for example `v2` will install the latest known `2.x.y` version. Version may be specified either with or without the `v` prefix, for example `v2.0.0` and `2.0.0` are semantically the same.

**`sc-client`**    
The ScanCentral Client version to install. Allowed values: `skip` (default value, do not install), `latest`, or specific version number. Supports semantic versioning, for example `23.1` will install the latest known `23.1.y` patch version. Version may be specified either with or without the `v` prefix, for example `v23.1` and `23.1` are semantically the same.

**`fod-uploader`**    
The FoDUploader version to install. Allowed values: `skip` (default value, do not install), `latest`, or specific version number. Supports semantic versioning, for example `v5` will install the latest known `5.x.y` version. Version may be specified either with or without the `v` prefix, for example `v5.4.0` and `5.4.0` are semantically the same.

**`vuln-exporter`**    
The FortifyVulnerabilityExporter version to install. Allowed values: `skip` (default value, do not install), `latest`, or specific version number. Supports semantic versioning, for example `v2` will install the latest known `2.x.y` version. Version may be specified either with or without the `v` prefix, for example `v2.0.4` and `2.0.4` are semantically the same.

**`bugtracker-utility`**    
The FortifyBugTrackerUtility version to install. Allowed values: `skip` (default value, do not install), `latest`, or specific version number. Supports semantic versioning, for example `v4` will install the latest known `4.x` version. Version may be specified either with or without the `v` prefix, for example `v4.12` and `4.12` are semantically the same.

### Action outputs

For each tool being installed, the action outputs several environment variables for use by later workflow steps.

**`PATH`**    
If the `export-path` action input was set to `true` (default), the bin-directory of the installed tool will be added to the workflow `PATH` environment variable.

**`<TOOL_NAME>_INSTALL_DIR`**    
Directory where the corresponding tool was installed. `<TOOL_NAME>` corresponds to the various action inputs, but converted to uppercase and dashes replaced by underscore, for example `FOD_UPLOADER_INSTALL_DIR`.

**`<TOOL_NAME>_BIN_DIR`**    
Bin-directory that holds the executables for the corresponding tool. `<TOOL_NAME>` corresponds to the various action inputs, but converted to uppercase and dashes replaced by underscore, for example `FOD_UPLOADER_BIN_DIR`.

**`<TOOL_NAME>_CMD`**    
Fully qualified path to the (primary) executable/script for the corresponding tool. `<TOOL_NAME>` corresponds to the various action inputs, but converted to uppercase and dashes replaced by underscore, for example `FOD_UPLOADER_CMD`.

### Sample usage

The sample workflow below demonstrates how to configure the action for installing the various Fortify tools and how to run these tools. Some notes:

* The `export-path` and `bugtracker-utility` inputs are set to their default values, and thus could have been omitted.
* The action supports semantic versioning, so the `vuln-exporter` input will install the latest known v2.x.y version of FortifyVulnerabilityExporter.

```yaml
    steps:    
      - name: Setup Fortify tools
        uses: fortify/github-action/setup@v1
        with:
          export-path: true
          fcli: latest
          sc-client: 23.1.0
          fod-uploader: latest
          vuln-exporter: v2
          bugtracker-utility: skip
      - name: Run fcli from PATH
        run: fcli -V
      - name: Run fcli using FCLI_CMD environment variable
        run: ${FCLI_CMD} -V
```

## package action


<!-- START-INCLUDE:action-package.md -->

This action packages application source code to be scanned using [ScanCentral Client](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/fortify-software-security-center/2310/SC_SAST_Help_23.1.0/index.htm#A_Clients.htm).

### Action environment variable inputs


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-package.md -->

**`EXTRA_PACKAGE_OPTS`**    
Optional: By default, this action runs `scancentral package -o package.zip`. The `EXTRA_PACKAGE_OPTS` environment variable can be used to specify additional packaging options like `-bt none` to disable automatic build tool detection, or `-oss` to collect additional files for an open-source scan (FoD only).
